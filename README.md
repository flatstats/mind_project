## About This Experiment

I have been wondering if instead of trying to map all the neurons in the brain... if we should maybe be trying to find the conditions in which made their emergence possible.

What if we donâ€™t simulate brains directly, but instead let emergent structure form itself?

So it brought me to creating this system which explores how local dynamics that are inspired by curvature, gradients, feedback, and noise might self-organize into early structures resembling developmental patterns.  

I didn't want to build a network, I wanted it to be an environment where agents respond to fields, pressures, and internal states without being told what to become.

So it's like sculpting with:

- Field curvature  
- Morphogen gradients  
- Feedback amplification  
- Echo and energy-based division  
- Role transitions based on percentile thresholds  
- Migration across dynamically evolving attractor landscapes

I would say this is loosely inspired by developmental neurobiology, but driven by music-like intuition such as tone, gain, resonance, decay.

## Core Model

- Agent-based system (`NeuralNode`)
- Morphogen gradients (anterior-posterior, dorsal-ventral, asymmetry)
- Lumen formation after simulated neural tube fusion
- Curvature Ã— field feedback attractor zones
- Roles: proliferative, neuron candidates, glia candidates, stabilizers, explorers
- Stochastic growth and division rules
